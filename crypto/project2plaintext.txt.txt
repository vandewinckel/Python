I BELIEVE THAT THE CARDINAL VIRTUES OF THE INDIVIDUAL ARE COURAGE, HONESTY, TEMPERANCE AND WISDOM; AND THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF SUCCESS IS SERVICE RENDERED—TO GOD, TO COUNTRY, AND TO MANKIND.
I BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF SOCIETY IS TO MAINTAIN A FREE GOVERNMENT WHEREIN LIBERTY MAY BE SECURED THROUGH OBEDIENCE TO LAW, AND THAT A CITIZEN SOLDIERY IS THE CORNERSTONE UPON WHICH SUCH A GOVERNMENT MUST REST.
I BELIEVE THAT REAL EDUCATION PRESUPPOSES A SENSE OF PROPORTION IN PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND MORAL DEVELOPMENT; AND THAT HE ALONE IS EDUCATED WHO HAS LEARNED THE LESSONS OF SELF- CONTROL AND OPEN-MINDEDNESS.
I BELIEVE IN NORWICH, MY ALMA MATER, BECAUSE WITHIN HER HALLS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THESE TENETS HAVE FOUND EXPRESSION WHILE MEN HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO BE LOYAL TO DULY CONSTITUTED AUTHORITY IN THOUGHT AND WORD AND DEED; TO VIEW SUFFRAGE AS A SACRED PRIVILEGE TO BE EXERCISED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DICTATES OF CONSCIENCE; TO REGARD PUBLIC OFFICE AS A PUBLIC TRUST; AND FINALLY TO FIGHT, AND IF NEED BE TO DIE, IN DEFENSE OF THE CHERISHED INSTITUTIONS OF AMERICA.
